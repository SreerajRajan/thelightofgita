                The war started. On the tenth day of the terrible war Bhishma, the captain general of the Kaurava army falls down by the arrow of Arjuna of the Pandava army. Sanjaya comes back and tells Dhrutarastra that Bhishma had fallen down. Hearing this Dhrutarastra falls unconscious for a while. When he woke up he asked Sanjaya to describe him in detail, from the beginning of the war, what had happened in the war field. Sanjaya describes with the help of his divine vision, the things that happened in the war field right from the beginning of the war. It is the situational background of Bagavad Gita, being revealed by Sri Krisna to Arjuna, as narrated by the great seer Vedavyasa.
            </p>
            <p class="slokadescription">
                The two armies were got ready for the war. Kauravas and Pandavas were cousin brothers. There were many relativities, friends and Gurus on both sides arrayed for the war. Bhishma and Drona were revered by both the Pandavas and the Kauravas; Bhishma being the great grand uncle of both the parties. He loved the Pandavas and Kauravas and was an undefeatable warrior. Seeing the great grand uncle Bhishma, Drona, friends and relatives; Arjuna underwent severe pressure and grief and that his mind was filled with fear and perplexity.
            </p>
            <p class="slokadescription">
                This chapter contains the mixed reactions of Arjuna, the great Pandava warrior on the commencement of the war. It is serious to note that a powerful warrior like Arjuna remains spellbound and frightened in the war field. In a war, all good relationships with the opponents ends.Any war conducted for physical benefits would bring pain and menace, though there are justifications on either side. A war may witness the shouting and cries of the wounded soldiers, and animals used in the war. Arjuna becomes nervous and reluctant to wage the war and puts forward a number of justifications not to fight the war. It is not proper to retreat from the war that has already become certain. Arjuna fears to fight against Bhishma and Drona. There is a saying that a person who chants the ten names of Arjuna would get relief from the complex of fear. But Arjuna fears. It is natural that if a powerful person is compelled to fight against a more powerful, there would generate fear in him. Arjuna debates vehemently with Sri Krisna, by logical justifications that he is not ready to fight. If so, Arjuna would have taken the decision well before coming into the war field.

        Dharmaksetra refers to the place where the fight is going on between the good and evil forces. The poetic connotation is that a conflict is continuously going on in the minds of the individuals and in the society between the good and the evil forces.

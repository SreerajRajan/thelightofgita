            <p class="slokadescription">
                The term yoga refers to the union of individual soul (unit self) with the Supreme (Paramatma). The Seers, the wise and the devotees of God incessantly try to attain the state of communion of their souls with the God, the Supreme consciousness. Those who try for the communion of soul by acquiring right knowledge of the Paramatma (Supreme) are called the Sankhya. Sri Krisna tries to reveal the secret of Sankhya yoga in this chapter. We are fortunate enough to know it through the discussions of Arjuna and Sri Krisna. The process of Jnana yoga, unveils the secrets of the most subtle realms of human mind   and even beyond. It is true that the discussion is not mainly concerned with the message of war but of the deep inner realities and possibilities of the human mind.
            </p>
            <p class="slokadescription">
                The discussion is not only confined to mind but also of subtler realms, i.e. related to spirituality. The impending war acts only as a veil to the secrets being revealed. We can see through out this chapter that a Pandora’s Box of knowledge open. We shall approach it with utmost humbleness to get the hidden knowledge unveiled. SriKrisna opens his deep discussion on conscious realms, starting from this chapter onwards, like a beautiful lotus getting slowly bloomed into its perfect beauty and glory.

        <br />Bishma was the great grand uncle of Pandavas and Kauravas and Drona was the guru who taught the art of archery to both the Pandavas and the Kauravas.
        <br />Killing of parents or gurus remains a severe and lasting pain of man in the history of his civilization.

            <p class="slokadescription">
                The Bhagavad Gita (Sanskrit: भगवद्गीता, bhagavad-gītā in IAST), often referred to as simply the Gita, is a verse Hindu scripture in Sanskrit that is part of the Hindu epic Mahabharata (chapters 23–40 of the 6th book of Mahabharata).
                The Gita is set in a narrative framework of a dialogue between Pandava prince Arjuna and his guide and charioteer Lord Krishna. Facing the duty as a warrior to fight the Dharma Yudhha or righteous war between Pandavas and Kauravas, Arjuna is counselled by Lord Krishna to "fulfill his Kshatriya (warrior) duty as a warrior and establish Dharma." Inserted in this appeal to kshatriya dharma (chivalry) is "a dialogue ... between diverging attitudes concerning methods toward the attainment of liberation (moksha)". The Bhagavad Gita was exposed to the world through Sanjaya, who senses and cognises all the events of the battlefield. Sanjaya is Dhritarashtra's advisor and also his charioteer.
                <br /><br />The Bhagavad Gita presents a synthesis of the concept of Dharma, theistic bhakti, the yogic ideals of moksha through jnana, bhakti, karma, and Raja Yoga (spoken of in the 6th chapter) and Samkhya philosophy. It is Bhagavata explanation of the Purusha Sukta and the Purushamedha Srauta yajna described in the Satapatha Brahmana.
                <br />Numerous commentaries have been written on the Bhagavad Gita with widely differing views on the essentials. Vedanta commentators read varying relations between Self and Brahman in the text: Advaita Vedanta sees the non-dualism of Atman (soul) and Brahman as its essence, whereas Bhedabheda and Vishishtadvaita see Atman and Brahman as both different and non-different, and Dvaita sees them as different. The setting of the Gita in a battlefield has been interpreted as an allegory for the ethical and moral struggles of the human life.
                <br /><br />The Bhagavad Gita's call for selfless action inspired many leaders of the Indian independence movement including Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi referred to the Gita as his "spiritual dictionary".
                <br /><br />Many of the authors, who interpreted and studied Bagavad Gita, have not well revealed the implied spiritual truths and meanings contained in it. Some consider Bagavad Gita as a guideline for the healthy social life. Yet some consider it as an effective approach to the problems of war and conflict. But Bagavad Gita covers almost all the human problems in physical, intellectual and spiritual realms and hence is comprehensive. Bagavad Gita spends most of its discussions on the psychological and spiritual aspects of human beings, mainly the conflict within the human mind. The great seer, Vedavyasa might have meant war as a continuous conflict taking place between the good and evil forces within one’s mind and in the collective mind of the society. To know the real wisdom of Bagavad Gita one must approach it with purity of mind and humbleness.
                <br /><br />In the present study a humble attempt is made to throw some light upon the psychological and spiritual aspects of Bagavad Gita with a view to making aware the common readers the implied meanings of it. This study is made as simple as possible eliciting the core ideas of the stanzas without merely insisting on the word meanings. Brief interpretations are also given wherever found necessary. I would be satisfied if anybody finds it worth to know the real sprit of Bagavad Gita with the help of this humble attempt.
                <br /><br />

                <p>The important methods of yoga are Karma yoga and Janana yoga, though there are other ways such as Bhakti yoga(Yoga of devotion), Samnyasa yoga(yoga of total surrender), Karma Samnyasa yoga etc. We know that all the developments of human society are based on karma(action). Even our life on earth is to do action. It is stated that the ultimate aim of our birth is to attain God, after shaking off all bondages, being attributed to our karma. Karmapasa is the bondage preventing us from realizing God and uniting with Him.</p>

                <p>There seldom exists right knowledge or right action alone. Right action and right knowledge are jointly called JnanaKarmayoga. Samnyasa refers to one's total surrender to God.The way by which one can lead to a peaceful life, surrendering himself to God is discussed in this chapter. What is important is yoga i.e. the union of soul with the God. The ultimate goal of every soul is its communion with the Supreme consciousness.</p>

                <p>Actions are performed with the help of sensory and motor organs and the mind. But the question is how an action affects a person; positively or negatively. Negative or positive impact of the action on individuals brings bondage to one's soul. Action bringing bondages to one's atma (soul) are not desirable. Karma samnyasa yoga stands for, internally surrendering the fruits of action unto the God, so that the atma shall not be affected by the bondages formed by actions.</p>

It is the true dhyana or meditation.Naturally all the thoughts are related to mundanities and attached to sensual desires.</p>

The knowledge regarding the particular family of the tree, the quality and nature of the leaves, the possible age of the tree, the structure and nature of the roots etc; refers to vijnana or analytical knowledge. Jnana in Bagavad Gita stands for the knowledge of the Supreme, the formless and attribute less Divinity.</p>
